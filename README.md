# Google AI API

A simple Google Apps Script used to call Google's Gemini AI API with a prompt. 

Usage:

`gCgAi(prompt,null);`

Where <prompt> is the question text you want to ask Gemini AI. For this to work you need a google AI account and sign up for Google Apps Scripting, both of which are free. Here is how to get started:
